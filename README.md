# Student Pass/Fail Predictor

This project is a simple machine learning application to predict whether a student will pass or fail based on their study and participation patterns.

## Features

- Predicts student pass/fail status using logistic regression
- Trained on a sample CSV dataset
- Provides accuracy metrics and confusion matrix
- Can be extended with Streamlit for interactive web app

## Files

- `student_data.csv` - training dataset
- `student_pass_fail_model.pkl` - saved trained model
- `student_predictor.ipynb` - Jupyter Notebook with full code
- `README.md` - project overview

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository  
2. Install dependencies (`scikit-learn`, `pandas`, etc.)  
3. Run the notebook to retrain or test  
4. Load the `pkl` model to make predictions on new data

## Future Work

- Integrate with Streamlit for an interactive web UI
- Improve feature engineering
- Deploy on cloud
